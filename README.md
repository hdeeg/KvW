# KvW
Kwee Van Woerden (KvW) method for eclipse or transit minimum timing, with improved error calculation. The main program is kvw.pro, written in IDL. It requires an input light curve of equidistant points that contain only the eclipse, without any off-eclipse points. A value for the rms (noise) of the input light curve is also requested (but not necessary). The eclipse minimum time is obtained using KvW's original method, but permits also the use of more than the 3 reflections of the original version. The error of the minimum time is calculated following the formula in Deeg (in prep.), with an optional calculation using KvW's original formula. The principal output is the eclipse mimum time with its error, with different levels of auxiliary textual and graphical output available.
